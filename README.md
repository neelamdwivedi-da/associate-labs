## Welcome to Daml Associate Level Lab Series!

This series is designed to help you practice the concepts you learn in the **Daml Associate Level Training Program**. 

As you complete the video-lessons in training, you can pick up the lab that aligns with the lessons you have completed. 

The following table gives a mapping from video-lessons to the lab that focuses on the learning objectives of those lessons.
